*"You just gotta jump in!"* - Alf

The Big Well is a natural landmark located in North-west Mudos that can be found in [Munch's Oddysee](/games/munchsoddysee).

The Big Well appears to be a massive geyser that fires anything that gos in, back out at incredible speed, 
this incredible launching speed is what allows Abe (temporary) access to Vykkers labs via the labs open bottom.

The Big Well design seems to have been decided very earily on as no concept art or alter designs are known at the time of writing.
