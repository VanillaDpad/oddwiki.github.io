description: "You first enter SpooceShrub Forest after leaving The Mighty Raisins cave, here you are introduced to Gamespeak by needing to greet Mudokon. Through the first puzzle gate and you'll be at the top of a small hill.
To your right is a small cliff and at the bottom is the first Well of the game, jump in and you'll be shot back out to the top of the cliff.
The the bottom of the hill to your right is another SpooceLock, once opened you are then showed how to greet multiple mudokons.
At the bottom of the hill and to the left you'll be introduced to Landmines.
Carrying on through the level you'll come across the Shaman again who will clue you in on the Resurrection Totem and how to use it.
Continuing on through the gate, over a bridge and through another gate and down a hill,you'll be meet with a Spoocelock. To your left is a Well and a load of Spooce. 
Past the Spoocelock you'll come out into a relatively wide open space with one section of highland in the center with several others dotted around it.
To the left of where you came in is a line of Landmines and at the top right of this area is a circle of Landmines placed around a Mudokon.
Once you've opened the wooden gate the Shaman will appear once more to inform Abe that the area up ahead and the Big Well are being guarded by Sligs and Slogs.
Once the iron gate has been opened you will be attacked by a Slig and four Slogs.
Infront of you is a tall wall of concrete and iron, a few shipping boxes and most notably a neon pink Vending Machine.
The Shaman will appear infront of the Vending Machine telling Abe of the field of Slogs that waits up ahead and not to worry about his friends as "they'll catch up to you later". 
Open the Spoocelock and press onto the end of the level. Just before you reach the tunnel opening the Shaman will once again appear, congratulating Abe on a job well done and ponders on how Munch is doing. 
That concludes the first level of Munchs Oddysee.

SpooceShrub Forest is the first level of Munchs Oddysee after exiting the tutorial in the Raisins cave.
The area is a relatively wide open forest area with most of the level acts as an introduction to a lot of mechanics such as Gamespeak, Landmines, Wells, Resurrection Totems, Vending Machines and Puzzles.
While a lot of the area hasn't been affected by the industrial side of Oddworlds touch, their presences is certainly made known by the various Landmines found in the locale and the presence of a Rent-A-Cop Slig and Slogs later on in the level.
