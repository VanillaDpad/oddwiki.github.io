name: "The Big Well"

quote: "\"You just gotta jump in!\" - Alf"

summary: "The Big Well is a natural landmark located in North-west Mudos that can be found in [Munch's Oddysee](/games/munchs-oddysee)."

appearance: "The Big Well appears to be a massive geyser that fires anything that goes into it back out at incredible speeds. This incredible launching speed is what allows [Abe](/characters/abe) (temporary) access to [Vykkers Labs](/locations/vykkers-labs) via the labs' open bottom."

trivia: "The Big Well design seems to have been decided very early on as no concept art or alter designs are known at the time of writing."
  "A popular theory among fans is that Alf is the Mudokon that pushed Abe in to the Big Well and it was later confirmed by Alf in [Dear Alf](https://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/oddworld.com/alf/ow_dearalf2_03.shtml)."
